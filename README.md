This is HTML5 application, built with [Brunch](http://brunch.io) and
[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) to be used as the steiner technologies
website.

## Getting started
* Install (if you don't have them):
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): `brew install node` on OS X
    * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`
    * [Bower](http://bower.io): `npm install -g bower`
    * Brunch plugins and Bower dependencies: `npm install & bower install`.
* Run:
    * `brunch watch --server` — watches the project with continuous rebuild.
      This will also launch HTTP server with
      [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
    * `brunch build --production` — builds minified project for production
* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write
      your code in `app/` dir.
    * Files saved in `app/assets` will be copied as are to `public`.
    * Write scripts in Javascript or Coffeescript in `app/scripts`.
    * Write styles in SCSS `app/styles`.
    * Make use of [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com),
      [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) anytime,
      anywhere.
